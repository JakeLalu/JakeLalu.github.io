		This is the highschool that I attended and graduated from in 2020 (unfortunately). Their website reads, <i>"De Smet Jesuit High School is a Catholic, college preparatory high school for boys located in Creve Coeur, Missouri, in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Louis. The school began classes in the fall of 1967. It was named in honor of the prominent Belgian Jesuit Great Plains missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet.</i> Many great memories there and a great place that made me who I am today.
